# Install fortran compiler (included in gcc):
brew doctor  # pre-requisite
brew update # pre-requisite
brew install gcc

# activate virtualenv (links TBD). Three options:
# 1. python-venv (for python>=3.5)
# 2. python-virtualenv
# 3. virtualenvwrapper (our choice)

# FROM NOW ON virtualenv is activated! EVERYTHIJNG WILL BE INSTALLED ON YOUR "copy" of pyhton 
# WITH no mess-up with the OS python distribution

# upgrade pip and setuptools:
pip install -U pip setuptools

# first install numpy (note: maybe that was necessary because we did not have gcc installed. However it's harmless to do it first now):
pip install numpy
# we also installed scipy first. This is maybe not necessary: we suspect we tried to do it
# because we did not have gcc installed (but we thought we have it). However, it should be harmless in any case:
pip install scipy
