# Installation

DISCLAIMER: **This document covers installation in development (or debug) 
mode, i.e. when the program is deployed locally, usually for testing, 
fixing bug or adding features.**

For installation in **production** mode, see `deploy.html` (note however
that the document was last updated in 2019)

## Requirements

```bash
sudo apt-get update # pre-requisite
sudo apt-get install gcc  # optional
sudo apt-get install git python3-venv python3-pip python3-dev
```

(The command above are Ubuntu specific, in macOS install brew and type
`brew install` instead of `apt-get install`. *Remove python3-dev as it does not
exist on macOS*).

This web service uses a *specific* version of Python (Open `setup.py` and 
check `python_requires=`. As of January 2022, it's 3.9.7) which you must 
install in addition to the Python version required by your system, and use
it. Any command `python3` hereafter will refer to the required Python version.


## Clone repository

Select a `root directory` (e.g. `/root/path/to/egsim`), and clone egsim into the
so-called egsim directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rizac/eGSIM.git egsim
```

## Create and activate Python virtual env

Move to whatever directory you want (usually the egsim directory above) and then:

```bash
python3 -m venv .env/<ENVNAME>  # create python virtual environment (venv)
source .env/<ENVNAME>/bin/activate  # activate venv
```

**NOTE: From now on, all following operations must have the virtualenv 
activated FIRST**

## Install

*Note: if the installation is done for upgrading all dependencies and 
`pip freeze` into new requirements files,
please go to [dependency upgrade](#dependencies-upgrade)* 


On the terminal, execute:
```bash
pip install --upgrade pip setuptools && pip install -r requirements.dev.txt
```
(use `requirements.txt` if you don't need to run tests, e.g. you are not 
installing as developer).

<details>

<summary>Full install (step by step)
</summary>

Having oq-engine and gmpe-smtk on the same level of the
egsim directory, you can install the bove in 
several steps for more control. From egsim directory:
```console
pip install --upgrade pip setuptools    
(cd ../oq-engine && pip install -e .)
(cd ../gmpe-smtk-rizac && pip install -e .)
# additional packages (plotly and kaleido are for downloading plot images):
pip install pyyaml tables plotly kaleido
# optional: 
# pip freeze > ./requirements.txt
pip install pytest pytest-cov pytest-django
# optional:
# pip freeze > ./requirements.dev.txt
```
</details>

<details>

<summary>
If you want also to be able to modify `gmpe-smtk`, e.g. 
fix bug, implement new features and issue Pull Requests to the master branch 
(click to expand): 
</summary>

Clone gmpe-smtk, usually on the same level
of the `egsim directory` into the so-called `smtk directory`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rizac/gmpe-smtk.git gmpe-smtk
```

**Note** that the current commit hash (`git log -1`) **should be the same** as
in `requirements.txt` (i.e., the string portion between '@' and '#' of the 
text line containing "smtk").

Then, (re)install smtk from the cloned directory:

```bash
cd ../gmpe-smtk # (or whatever you cloned the forked branch)
pip install -e .
```

and have a look at [Fixing gmpe-smtk](#Fix-smtk)
for the suggested workflow

</details>


## Run Test

**Note: the value of `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` in the examples below
must be changed in production**

Move in the `egsim directory` and type:

```bash
export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=egsim.settings_debug; pytest -xvvv --ds=egsim.settings_debug ./tests/
```
(x=stop at first error, v*=increase verbosity). 

Test with code coverage, i.e.
showing the amount of code hit by tests:

```bash
export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=egsim.settings_debug; pytest -xvvv --cov=./egsim/ --cov-report=html ./tests/
```

(you can also invoke the commands without `export ...` but 
using the `--ds` option: `pytest -xvvv --ds=egsim.settings_debug ./tests/`)


# Usage

**Note: the value of `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` in the examples below
must be changed in production**

If you didn't do already, perform 
a [Complete DB reset](#Complete-DB-reset)
(**one-time only operation**)

If you want to access the admin panel, see [the admin panel](#admin-panel).

**To run the program in your local browser**, type:

```bash
export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE="egsim.settings_debug";python manage.py runserver 
```

(you can also invoke the commands without `export ...` but using the 
`--settings` option: 
`python manage.py --settings=egsim.settings_debug [command]`)


# Maintenance

<details>
<summary>
Brief Introduction to some important concepts and key terms (click to show)
</summary>

 - [Settings file](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/topics/settings/): 
   A Django settings file contains all the configuration of your Django 
   installation. The settings file referred in this document, 
   included in this git repo, is for debug and local deployment only.
   On production, a separate settings file is used, located on the server 
   outside the git repo and **not shared for security reasons**.

   
 - [manage.py](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/django-admin/) or
   `django-admin` is Djangoâ€™s command-line utility for administrative tasks.
   It is invoked from the terminal within your Python virtualenv (see examples
   in this document) by providing the settings file via:
   ```bash
   export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=<settings_file_path> python manage.py <command>
   ```
   (see examples in this document).
   Django allows also the implementation of custom management commands.
   eGSIM implements `egsim-init` in order to populate the db (more details 
   below)


 - [app](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/intro/reusable-apps/) a 
   Django app is a Python package that is specifically intended for use in 
   a Django project. An application may use common Django conventions, such as 
   having models, tests, urls, and views submodules. In our case, the Django
   project is the egsim root directory (created with the command
   `django-admin startproject egsim`), and the *Django apps* inside it are 
   "api" (the core web API) and "app" (the *web app*, i.e. the part of eGSIM
   delivered over the Internet through a browser interface), that relies on 
   the "api" code.
   Inside the settings file (variable `INSTALLED_APPS`) is configured the list 
   of all applications that are enabled in the eGSIM project. This includes not 
   only our "api" app, that tells Django to create the eGISM tables when
   initializing the database, but also several builtin Django apps, e.g. the 
   Django `admin` app, visible through the [Admin panel](#admin-panel)).

</details>

## Starting a Python terminal shell

**Note: the value of `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` in the examples below
must be changed in production**

Typing `python` on the terminal does not work if you need to import django
stuff, as there are things to be initialized beforehand. The Django `shell`
command does this:

```bash
export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE="egsim.settings_debug";python manage.py shell 
```

## Admin panel

**Note: the value of `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` in the examples below
must be changed in production**

This command allows the user to check database data from the 
web browser. For further details, check the 
[Django doc](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/django-admin/)

The database must have been created and populated (see [Usage](#usage)). 

Create a super user (to be done **once only** ):
```bash
export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE="egsim.settings_debug";python manage.py createsuperuser
```
and follow the instructions.

Start the program (see [Usage](Usage)) and then navigate in the browser to 
`[SITE_URL]/admin` (in development mode, `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/`)

*Note: Theoretically, you can modify db data from the browser, but to make 
changes persistent after a database reset you should implement them in 
the management command `egsim_init` (see [Repopulate the DB](#Repopulate-the-DB))*

## Complete DB reset

**Note: the value of `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` in the examples below
must be changed in production**

Every time you change something in the Database schema, e.g. 
a table, a column, a constraint
(see `egsim.api.models.py`), you need to run DB migrations.

However, as eGSIM does not need to store user-defined data in the database, 
it is often easier to throw everything away and regenerate all db schema and data 
from scratch.

To perform a db reset:
 - delete or rename `db.sqlite3` (or wherever the database is)
 - delete all migrations (currently under "egsim/api/migrations"), i.e.
   all all .py files except `__init__.py`
 - Create and run migrations:
 
   ```bash
   export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE="egsim.settings_debug";python manage.py makemigrations
   export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE="egsim.settings_debug";python manage.py migrate
   ```
 - [Repopulate the db](#Repopulate-the-DB)
 
 - [**Optional**] Re-add the Django admin superuser(s) as explained in the
   [admin panel](#admin-panel) above
   

## Repopulate the DB

NOTE: If you don't have created and initialized the db yet, go to 
[Complete DB reset](#Complete-DB-reset)

When the db is created for the first time or reset, 
OpenQuake is upgraded, or new data is implemented (new regionalization 
or flatfile), you need to repopulate the database and the filesystem, 
to make changes available to eGSIM users.
Execute the custom management command `egsim_init`:

```bash
   export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE="egsim.settings_debug";python manage.py egsim_init
```
 

## Migrate and populate the db

**DISCLAIMER**: Consider
performing a [Complete db reset](#complete-db-reset)
instead.

<details>

<summary>Details (click to expand)</summary>

Before reading, remember:

 - **the value of `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` in the examples below 
   must be changed in production**
 - The `make_migration` command just generates a migration file, it doesn't 
   change the db. The `migrate` command does that, by means of the migration 
   files generated. For details on Django migrations, see:
   - https://realpython.com/django-migrations-a-primer/#changing-models
   - https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/topics/migrations/#workflow

   
#### Steps:   

1. Edit the eGSIM models (module `egsim.models.py`. **In production,
   just run** `git pull`)
2. Make a migration (**This does not run a migration, see note above**):
   
   ```bash
   export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE="egsim.settings_debug";python manage.py makemigrations egsim --name <migration_name>
   ```

   (<migration_name> will be a suffix appended to the migration file, use it
   like you would use a commit message in `git`).
   
   **NOTE**: Django might ask you how to fill non-nullable 
   fields (db columns), if added. Just provide whatever default, because a 
   migration is supposed to be followed by a `egsim_init` execution that will
   re-populate all egsim tables. However, you might need to empty
   the database manually before running `migrate` (see below), otherwise
   the migration might not work if e.g., the field is unique
   
3. Should the db be repopulated differently in account of the new 
   changes (probably yes)?
   Then implement these changes in the existing 
   commands, or create a new one, see `README.md` in 
   `egsim/api/management/commands`
   
4. Run `test_initdb` in `/tests/test_commands.py` (it re-creates
   from scratch a test db, runs all migrations and `egsim_init`)

4. (optional) Make a backup of the database
   
5. Run migration (command `migrate`). **Note**: if the migration 
   will introduce new non-nullable fields, maybe better to run 
   `manage.py flush` first to empty all tables, to avoid conflicts
   
   ```bash
   export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE="egsim.settings_debug";python manage.py migrate egsim
   ```

   ("egsim" above is the app name. If you omit the app, all apps will be 
   migrated. The command `migrate` does nothing if it detects that there is 
   nothing to migrate)
   
6. Repopulate all eGSIM tables (command `egsim_init`)

## Create a custom management command

See `egsim/api/management/commands/README.md`.

The next two sections will describe how to store
new data (regionalizations and flatfiles) that will be
made available in eGSIM by means of two management commands


## Add new predefined flatfiles

- Add the file (CSV or zipped CSV) in
  `managements/commands/data/predefined_flatfiles`. 
  Do **not** commit files too big (**max few tens of Mb**). When zipping in 
  macOS you will probably need to
  [exclude or remove (after zipping) the ___MACOSX folder](https://stackoverflow.com/q/10924236)
  
- Implement a new `FlatfileParser` class in 
  `management/commands/flatfile_parsers.py`
  The parser goal is to read the file and convert it into a harmonized HDF 
  table (see ESM parser in the Python file)

- Add binding file -> parser in the Python `dict`:
  `management.commands._egsim_flatfiles.Command.PARSER`

- (Optional) Add the file data source 
  in `management/commands/data/data_sources.yaml`, e.g. data reference, url, 
  (see examples in the YAML file). 

  *NOTE: In the data source you can also set the 
  data name, i.e. a unique, usually short alphanumeric string that will 
  identify the flatfile in user requests. If no 
  data source or name is provided, the public name will be the file name 
  before the first ".".*

- Repopulate all eGSIM tables (command `egsim_init`)

Implemented flatfiles sources (click on the items below to expand)

<details>
<summary>ESM 2018 flatfile</summary>

- Go to https://esm.mi.ingv.it//flatfile-2018/flatfile.php
(with username and password, you must be registered 
  beforehand it's relatively fast and simple)

- Download `ESM_flatfile_2018.zip`, uncompress and extract
  `ESM_flatfile_SA.csv` from there 
  
- `ESM_flatfile_SA.csv` is our raw flatfile, compress it 
  again (it's big) into this directory as 
  `ESM_flatfile_2018_SA.zip`
 
- If on macOS, type the command above to remove the
  macOS folder from the zip
</details>


## Add new regionalization

- Add two files *with the same basename* and extensions 
  - .geojson (regionalization, aka regions collection) and
  - .json (region -> gsim mapping)
  
  in `managements/commands/data/regionalization_files`. Usually, these files 
  are copied and pasted from the `shakyground2` project (see GFZ gitlab), but 
  if you neeed to implement your own see examples in the given directory 
  or ask the developers

- (Optional) Add the file data source 
  in `management/commands/data/data_sources.yaml`, e.g. data reference, url, 
  (see examples in the YAML file). 

  *NOTE: In the data source you can also set the 
  data name, i.e. a unique, usually short alphanumeric string that will 
  identify the regionalization in user requests. If no 
  data source or name is provided, the public name will be the file name 
  before the first ".".*

- Repopulate all eGSIM tables (command `egsim_init`)


## Dependencies upgrade

Please note that it is safer (from now even 
[mandatory](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63277123/what-is-use-feature-2020-resolver-error-message-with-jupyter-installation-on)
with `pip`) to upgrade all dependencies
instead of single packages in order to avoid conflicts.

Consequently, we recommend to follow this procedure also
in case of a GitHub security issue (or dependency alert) on a single package.

To upgrade all dependencies, we just need to `pull` the newest version
of `smtk` and relaunch an installation from there (this will fetch
also the newest OpenQuake version and all dependencies automatically)

First create and activate a new virtualenv:

```bash
python3 -m venv .env/<ENVNAME>  # create python virtual environment (venv)
source .env/<ENVNAME>/bin/activate  # activate venv
pip install --upgrade pip setuptools
```

Then install smtk and all dependencies:

```bash
cd ../gmpe-smtk # (or whatever you cloned the forked branch)
git checkout master && git pull
pip install -e . # (also installs openquake and django)
cd ../egsim. # (or wherever egsim is)
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

And finally install the newest version of the test packages:

```bash
pip install pylint pytest-django pytest-cov
pip freeze > requirements.dev.txt
```

Finally, proceed with the normal workflow:
run tests, fix new bugs and eventually `git push`, as always.


## Fix smtk

We will refer to smtk as the [forked branch](https://github.com/rizac/gmpe-smtk)
used by eGSIM. As we have seen during installation, it is a forked repository 
from the [upstream branch](https://github.com/GEMScienceTools/gmpe-smtk.git).

By convention **the last commit of the `master` branch of smtk is the updated 
one which can be used in production** (basically, the one written in the 
`requirements` text files).
Therefore, when fixing a smtk issue or implementing a new feature, switch to 
a dev branch (we usually use the branch called ... "dev").

Then simply implement your changes, tests and issue a PR, as usual.
Meanwhile, because in dev mode smtk is usually installed as editable 
('-e' flag), you don't need to change anything locally, as the new 
features/fixes are already available in eGSIM.
Then, *once the PR is merged in the upstream branch*, you can switch back to 
the "master" branch in smtk, and merge from the upstream branch, as follows:

<details>
	<summary>First make sure you added the upstream branch 
(one-time operation)</summary>

Type:

```bash
git remote -v
```

if you see these lines

```bash
upstream https://github.com/GEMScienceTools/gmpe-smtk.git (fetch)
upstream https://github.com/GEMScienceTools/gmpe-smtk.git (push)
```

skip the line below. Otherwise, add the upstream branch by typing:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/GEMScienceTools/gmpe-smtk.git
```
</details>

Then merge:

```bash
# Fetch all the branches of that remote into remote-tracking branches, such as upstream/master:
git fetch upstream

# Switch to master branch if you are not already there
git checkout master

# Merge:
git merge upstream/master
```

Finally, update the smtk version: issue a `git log -1` and copy the commit
hash into the two `requirements` text files.
Open them, find the line where `gmpe-smtk` is listed and replace the commit 
hash in the portion of the line between '@' and '#'. Eventually, issue a 
`git push`
