# This YAML file contains the flatfile columns metadata to be stored in the database
# as instances of `egsim.api.models.FlatfileColumn`s, and their mapping with OpenQuake
# models parameters. See also `egsim_init.py` for usage

# Flatfile column format:
#
# <column_name>:
#   dtype:   The data type (default when missing: float). Supported values are:
#            float, int, str, datetime, bool, or the list of the possible values
#            that the field can have (categorical data)
#   bounds:  The bounds [min, max], endpoints included. Default when missing:
#            [null, null], where null means: unbounded / don't check
#   default: The default value when nothing is provided. When missing,
#            the default value depends `dtype` or storage (e.g. pandas vs sql).
#            E.g., with pandas: NaN (for dtype float), NaT (datetime), None/null
#            (str or categorical), 0 (int), False (bool)
#   help:    The field help or description (defaults to "" when missing)

# YAML notes:
# Unless required, strings do not need to be quoted. YAML is a superset of JSON,
# so you can type lists as JSON Arrays: [...] and Mappings as JSON Objects: {...}.
# If you want to type over multiple lines for readability, prefix the text with >-
# (see examples here below or https://stackoverflow.com/a/3790497)
