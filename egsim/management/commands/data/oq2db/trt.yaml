# This YAML file defines the Tectonic Region types (TRT) of eGSIM in the form
# of a YAML dictionary:
# - Keys MUST be unique name of TRTs and are the values exposed to the user's
#   requests (see Note [1] for details)
# - Values are YAML sequences (indented lines of text starting with "- ") of
#   name aliases that will be used to identify a TRT in the management commands
#   reg2db and gsimsel2db (see Note [2] for details)

# Additional notes:
# [1] Keys can be made of only alphabetic characters and the underscore. The
#     command `oq2db` raises if not the case
# [2] The set of values should include all OpenQuake TRTs (see attribute values
#     of the class Trt reported below). The command `oq2db` raises if not the case
# [3] When any new regionalization (reg2db) or GSIM selection (gsimsel2db) is added,
#     the program will warn if any TRT is not defined and the user can:
#     1: fix the code
#     2: add another alias to an existing TRT here
#     3. Add a completely new TRT following the same rules (no spaces no underscores)
